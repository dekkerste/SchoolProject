# Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in development and in production.
#
# What problem does a virtual environment solve? The more Python projects you have, the more likely it is that you need
# to work with different versions of Python libraries, or even Python itself. Newer versions of libraries for one
# project can break compatibility in another project.
#
# Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one
# project will not affect other projects or the operating systemâ€™s packages.
